# nice-bot
![dank_icon](images/dank_icon.png?raw=true "Dank icon")

Discord niceness dank bot tracker. It will keep track of every nice comment made within the case insensitive regex: `(?<!\S)n+i+c+e+(?!\S)`, in a context-free grammar. If it has any mentions or quotes, it will also keep track of them.

One service of the bot supports being included in multiple servers, metrics and quotes won't collide. Bare in mind that it is not meant to be used in 200 servers with 5000 members each; I mean, if `pandas` can support it then you're free to try, but whatever, man.

### Install

#### Debian route

It's a debian package, you should do it inside a virtual environment.

1. Install all dependencies inside `debian/control`
2. Run in project root `debuild -us -uc` and then `debuild clean`.
3. Finally in parent dir `sudo dpkg -i nice-bot_<version>_<architecture>.deb`

#### Poetry route (for development)

If you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) installed:

1. Clone repository.
2. `poetry install` to generate venv with dependencies.
3. `bash scripts/install.sh` to create necessary directories.
4. `poetry run nicebot` to start the bot service.

### Usage
If went the debian route, there is a systemd service for the bot: `service nicebot start`.
If you are using poetry, go into the repository and run `poetry run nicebot` to start the bot.

Logs are in `/var/log/nice-bot/bot.log`, but you can manipulate it as you want in configuration file.

### Development

#### Without poetry:

1. Clone repo.
2. `virtualenv --python=python3.7 venv`
3. `. venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -e . -r requirements.txt`
5. `bash scripts/install.sh`
6. `python bot/service.py`

#### With poetry:

1. Clone repo
2. `poetry install`
3. `bash scripts/install.sh`
4. `poetry run nicebot`


### Configuration
This project uses [confight](https://github.com/Avature/confight), so configs are read in the following fashion:
1. `/etc/nice-bot/config.toml`
2. `/etc/nice-bot/conf.d/*`

Secrets and other overrides should be put inside `conf.d` folder in order to guarantee a clean debian installation.
